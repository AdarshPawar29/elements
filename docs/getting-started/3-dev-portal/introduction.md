## Introduction to Elements Dev Portal

Elements comes in two flavours, the basic package which only covers a single API, and Elements Dev Portal, which is backed by Stoplight Platform and can do many many things. 

- Support multiple APIs
- Markdown Articles
- Mock Server integration
- Version Selector (Multiple Branches)
- Powerful Search

Think of the dev portal as more of a Content Management System, focused entirely on making an awesome developer experience for an organization.
